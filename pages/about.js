            <p>Fat burgers are the same as old burgers with a classic recipe, the right size and at a reasonable price.</p>
            <p>They are prepared in the American, Mexican and Italian manners, sparing neither the sauce nor the filling.</p>
            <p>For those who are pretty hungry, there is an immense "Fattest Burger" with five beef patties, corn chips and cheese.</p>
